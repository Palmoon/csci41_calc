# interface
Ignore the Variable Class.  Will be using a map to hold the variables.
Interface will have check for int8_t so that user cannot input value higher than 255

Have the operators return an int value.  int8_t is compatible with int so it'll be fine.
Change the Normal Class back to Number... since we don't really need the Variable class.  I'll have the values
incremented in the map.
